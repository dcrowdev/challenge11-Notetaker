This is a node.js notetaker application deployed on heroku.

[Linked to deployed heroku app](https://dreadful-spirit-98896.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This is our third node.js project and second challenge using express. It allows the user to create,  
save, and delete notes. I enjoyed learning how to build routes in express and this activity  
helped me better understand node modularization and express!

### Installing

This app is fully deployed on herokus free hosting. No install necessary!

### Executing program

Simply give your note a title and some text and click the save icon in the top right!  
The trashcan next to each note will allow you to delete that note.

### Testing

No testing available.
